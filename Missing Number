#LEETCODE 268

#Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

# java code..............

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
      int sum=0;
      for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
        sum=sum+nums[i];
        //it is use for calculate the total sum of all numbers present in the given array
      } 
      int actualsum =(nums.length*(nums.length+1))/2;
      //for calculating the sum  of continuous series of numbers
      int missingnumber=actualsum-sum;
      //in this step we know that the missing number is nothing whatever the actualsum minus sum of numbers of the given array 
      return missingnumber;
    }
}
