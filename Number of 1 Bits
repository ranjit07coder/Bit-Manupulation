#LEETCODE 191

#Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of 
set bits
 in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).
Example 1:

Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation:
The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

#java code 

class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count=0;
        while (n>0){
            if(n%2==1){
                count++;
            }
            n=n/2;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
