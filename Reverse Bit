#REVERSE BIT PROBLEM
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Note: You need treat n as an unsigned value


public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int rev = 0;  // This will hold the reversed bits
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {

            rev <<= 1;

            int bit = n & 1;

            rev |= bit;

            n >>= 1;
        }
        return rev;   
    }
}
